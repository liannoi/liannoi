In my opinion, this repository / file should serve as some kind of reference
information about the developer's profile and the structure of his repositories.
Thus, it will make life easier for HR, as they will be able to spend less time
trying to find really those repositories that the developer could be proud of.
Among other things, this is useful for the developers themselves, as they can
more easily monitor the state of their profiles and repositories.

**So, I try to follow the following non-vowel requirements for naming repositories:**

- [Android](#android)
- [API](#api)
- [Sample](#sample)
- [Learning](#learning)
- [Term papers](#term-papers)
- [Exam](#exam)
- [Unique naming](#unique-naming)

## Android

a specific topic, of development for Android platform.

## API

![](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)

Prefix for naming repositories that are API / RESTful APIs. They can be freely
deployed on your local machine or remote server and used.

> There are certain nuances with the code, as some projects access **Azure storage**,
> which **are no longer available** and will not work. Consider this when
> reviewing the work. The idea of the Web API remains absolutely the same, the
> only thing that needs to be done is to **deploy locally and change the endpoints
> of the call to the ones you need**.

| API                                                         | Description                                                                                 | Auth | HTTPS | CORS |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|-------|------|
| [Shop ADO](https://github.com/liannoi/api-shop-ado)         | Classic RESTful Web API implemented in CQRS architecture.                                   | No   | Yes   | Yes  |
| [Many-to-many](https://github.com/liannoi/api-many-to-many) | Solving the problem of working with a many-to-many relationship with Entity Framework Core. | No   | Yes   | Yes  |

## Sample

short period of time to summarize the technologies learned and the knowledge
gained.

## Unique naming

![](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/locked.svg)

Unique names for repositories aren't tied to the subject being studied and aren't
exam papers. Ideas for their implementation: were proposed by teachers, were
homework that I wanted to do better than average. Or they are aggregate repos
(those that internally link to others).
